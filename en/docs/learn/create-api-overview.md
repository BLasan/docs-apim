# Design APIs Overview

!!! Note
    This page consists of a summary of API creation and also acts as an index for all sub sections.

API creation is the process of linking an existing backend API implementation to the API Publisher. This is done so that you can manage and monitor the API's lifecycle, documentation, security, community, and subscriptions. Alternatively, you can provide the API implementation in-line in the API Publisher itself.
