# Streaming Overview

Streaming Integrator(SI) is a streaming data processing server that integrates streaming data and takes action based on streaming data. The streaming integration capabilities of EI are delivered via this runtime

WSO2 SI can be effectively used for:

* Realtime ETL: CDC for DBs, tailing files, scraping HTTP Endpoints, etc.
* Work with streaming messaging systems: It is fully compatible with Kafka and NATS, and provides advanced stream processing capabilities required to utilize the full potential of streaming data.
* Streaming data Integration: Allows you to treat all data sources as streams and connect them with any destination.
* Execute complex integrations based on streaming data: SI has native support to work hand-in-hand with WSO2 Micro integrator to trigger complex integration flows based on decisions derived via stateful stream processing logic.
